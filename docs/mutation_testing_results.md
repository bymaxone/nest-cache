## Final — 2026-05-31 (after hardening)

**Global mutation score at the time of this pass: 100.00%** — 427 killed, 6 timeout, **0 survived** (316 compile-error mutants excluded). `pnpm mutation` exits 0 (≥ `break: 95`). Run time ~2m53s under Node 24. Every mutated file scores 100%.

The 50 survivors found in the baseline below were all killed by strengthening the existing unit tests (no source logic changed):

- **Throw-site `details`** (most survivors, in default-options / key-builder / json-serializer / cache.service / script-manager / connection.manager): tests asserted the exception `code` but not the `details` object, so `{}` / `''` mutants survived. Fix: assert the exact `details` payload (`toEqual`) at each throw site.
- **Boundary operators** (`shutdownTimeoutMs` / `connectTimeout` `<` MIN): added tests at exactly the minimum so a `<=` mutant is caught.
- **Optional chaining** (`cluster.nodes?.length`): added a cluster test with `nodes` undefined (the `?.` guards a TypeError).
- **URL regex** (`/^\d+$/`): added multi-digit, digit-prefixed, and digit-suffixed db-segment cases to pin `^`, `$`, and `+`.
- **Conditional/credentials** (`if (parsed.username)` / `parsed.password`, sentinel `password` spread): added absent-credential cases and a Redis-constructor-arg assertion.
- **Idempotency / lazy subscriber** (pubsub `makeUnsubscribe`, `ensureSubscriber`): assert detach (`subscriber.off`) and `createSubscriberClient` are each called exactly once.

**Zero suppressions remain** — the production source carries no coverage/mutation directives. The one would-be equivalent (`parse-redis-url` `/^\//` vs `/\//` on a URL pathname) was instead refactored to `.slice(1)`, which is regex-free and whose `slice` mutants are all killed by the db-segment tests; and the `forRootAsync` `base.providers ?? []` fallback is covered by a dedicated spec (mocking the inherited base method to omit providers) rather than ignored.

The 6 `connection.manager.ts` timeouts are detected mutants (Stryker counts a timeout as killed) — a mutated retry/backoff path that spins; they do not lower the score.

## Baseline — 2026-05-31 (first successful full run, before hardening)

**Global mutation score: 88.48%** — 378 killed, 6 timeout, 50 survived (316 compile-error mutants excluded by the TypeScript checker). Run time ~2m52s under Node 24.

> ⚠️ **This is the first time the full mutation suite has ever run successfully.** Until Phase 4 it could not run under Node 24: `jest.stryker.config.ts` imported `./jest.config` without a file extension, which Node 24's native TypeScript type-stripping (ESM mode) rejects (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). Phase 4 fixed that import (`./jest.config.ts`), which is what unblocked this baseline. The scores below therefore reflect **pre-existing** Phase 1–3 test strength that mutation had never measured before.

(`cache-error-codes.ts` / `cache.exception.ts` / `resolve-serializer.ts` and the shared constants either score 100% or have only compile-error mutants.)

### Acceptance-criteria status at baseline (CACHE-046 / plan §5.5) — all later met, see Resolution

- [x] **Global ≥ 85%** — 88.48% ✅
- [ ] **Critical paths ≥ 95%** — only `cache.service.ts` (95.45%) clears the bar. `key-builder.ts` (71%), `parse-redis-url.ts` (82%), `default-options.ts` (78%) and `script-manager.service.ts` (82%) are **below** it. ❌
- [x] `reports/mutation/mutation.html` generated ✅
- [x] `docs/mutation_testing_results.md` updated ✅
- [ ] `pnpm mutation` exits 0 — currently **exit 1**: global 88.48% < `thresholds.break = 95`. ❌

### Interpretation

The pre-existing suite has 100% line/branch coverage but ~50 surviving mutants — paths that are executed without an assertion pinning the value they produce (side-effect-only assertions, unpinned `?? default` fallbacks, and constant/boundary mutants exposed by `ignoreStatic: false`). The run did its intended job: it **identified the weak tests**. The Phase 4 code (`forRootAsync` + the builder `setExtras`) scores 100%.

### Surviving-mutant hotspots to harden

1. `key-builder.ts` (6) — separator/namespace joins (`:47/:50/:65`); assertions check the joined key but not the exact separator placement.
2. `default-options.ts` (14) — `?? default` branches and validation thresholds; the fallback values aren't pinned by a test.
3. `parse-redis-url.ts` (6) — URL field-extraction branches (`:42/:45/:49/:50`); some may be equivalent (`??` vs `||` where empty string is valid — plan §5.5).
4. `script-manager.service.ts` (3) — `EVALSHA` arg counts and NOSCRIPT-marker handling.
5. `connection.manager.ts` (10 survived + 6 timeout) — listener wiring + shutdown race; the timeouts suggest a mutant that spins (needs investigation).
6. `pubsub.service.ts` (5), `json-serializer.ts` (2) — non-critical, worth tightening.

> Equivalent mutants must be documented inline with `// Stryker disable next-line <Mutator>: <reason>` — and only after confirming no test can kill them.

## Resolution

All 50 baseline survivors were killed in Phase 4 by strengthening the unit tests (see the Final section above). `pnpm mutation` now exits 0 at **100.00%**, clearing the `break: 95` gate and the §5.5 critical-path ≥95% rule (every critical path is 100%). Ten unit tests were added/strengthened, and the production source carries **zero** coverage/mutation suppressions (the would-be equivalent regex was refactored to `.slice(1)`; the optional-providers fallback is test-covered). No source behaviour was changed — only the leading-slash strip was rewritten as an equivalent `.slice(1)`.

## Re-run — 2026-08-06

| Metric             | Value        |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| **Mutation score** | **99.78 %**  |
| Surviving mutants  | 1            |
| Break threshold    | 95 % -> PASS |

`findProvider` gained a spec of its own. It had only ever been exercised through the module
suites, where every lookup succeeded through one half of its disjunction or the other, so either
half could be dropped and those suites would still pass.

The one survivor is `configurable: false` on the withheld connection accessor. It is equivalent
HERE because the resolved options are `Object.freeze`d on the way out and freezing makes every
property non-configurable anyway. The flag stays: it states the guarantee where the accessor is
defined, and the storage package withholds its credentials the same way WITHOUT freezing, where
it is the only thing enforcing it.

The zero-suppressions rule above still holds. Inline directives were added during this pass and
then removed: this package documents equivalents here rather than annotating the source, and that
convention outranks a higher number.

Every equivalence claim in this section was checked by running the mutant, not by reading it.
Where a `// Stryker disable next-line` directive was found not to apply — above a `} catch {`, a
`.replace()` inside a method chain, a multi-line `sort(...)` argument, or anywhere inside a
builder chain — it was replaced with the block `disable`/`restore` form, or, where that does not
work either, with a plain comment at the line so the reasoning is visible rather than silently
ineffective.
